Motor Vehicle Registration

TAJ ðŸ¡ª Fitness & Insurance 

Develop an Online Motor Vehicle Registration website which will allow a user to renew their motor vehicle registration.
During registration the system should use web services to check if their fitness and insurance are up to date.

The Motor Vehicle Registration System should:
Allow user to logon to their profile							
Allow user to view their existing vehicle registrations				
Allow user to link an existing vehicle registration to their profile			
Allow user to update their registration for either 6 months or 1 year from the expiry date (letâ€™s assume payment is handled separately)						
System should check of the Motor Vehicle Insurance is up to date using a web service (web service should accept the license plate registration number OR chassis number)
System should check if the Motor Vehicle Fitness is up to date using a web service (web service should accept the chassis number)
System should not allow registration to be updated if Insurance or Fitness is not update - system should display appropriate message to user

The Motor Vehicle Insurance System should:
Allow another System to check if a Motor Vehicle Insurance is up to date via web service			
(This web page can be found at MVIS.aspx)

The Motor Vehicle Fitness System should:
Allow another System to check if a Motor Vehicle Fitness is up to date via web service
(This web page can be found at MVFS.aspx)
